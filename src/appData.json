        "summary": "No-one is better than director Bong Joon Ho at using the rules of genre filmmaking against his audience. In the extraordinary Parasite, he engineered a mid-film switch from social comedy to something much darker and more outrageous; in Snowpiercer, it emerged that the revolutionary struggle we’d been rooting for was only a fraction of the true battle for survival. Now, in Mickey 17, he tackles space travel and the colonisation of alien worlds. If it’s a more conventional film than his best work, he still finds ways to subvert our expectations and continually surprise us with a hero who’s just trying his inadequate best.",
